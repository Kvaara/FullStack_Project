1. Open up terminal (cmd) and head to the project directory and install the required dependencies by using 'npm i' or 'npm install'. YOU NEED TO INSTALL NODE: https://nodejs.org/en/.

2. Run the app.js by using node, which is located in the 'src' folder (node app.js). Example: 'node app.js'.

3. It should now be running on port 3000. Go to localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000.

This app uses SQLite, which is much lighter and doesn't require an external installation like MongoDB does. SQLite creates a database file called "uni" to ./src/ and you can easily see the data by downloading a free GUI program called DB Browser for SQLite: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/ and opening the uni file using the program.
